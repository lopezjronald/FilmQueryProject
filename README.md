## Overview
This application prompts the user to search by Film ID, Keyword, or to exit the system. If the user chooses to search by the Film ID, it will search through a database based on the Film ID. If it's not found, it will let the user know and take the user back to the original menu. The same will occur if the user chooses to look up a film based on a specific keyword.

## Technologies Used:
- MySQL
- Eclipse
- Java
- Terminal Commands
- GitHub/Git

## Lessons Learned
I read through the notes and conceptually understood how to connect the Java application to the database. The queries were simple, using Join statements to connect from various tables in the database. Once I figured out how to connect to the database and entering the correct statements, the task of not duplicating information took awhile. I created separate methods in order to accomplish that task.
